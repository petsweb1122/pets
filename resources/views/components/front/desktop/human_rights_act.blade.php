    <h1>HUMAN RIGHTS POSITION STATEMENT</h1>	
    <hr>
        <p>In today’s world, we often hear of people who live at the poverty level, people who do not have any food or water.  People get exploited on a daily basis due to their poverty or vulnerabilities.  Petssified.com, Inc. believes that the global economy — and our global businesses need do something about this!   We feel that we need to be able to empower people who do not have anything!   It is important for them to succeed but they do not have the means or the ability.  Petssified.com, Inc. believes in the global possibilities of helping those in need in our domestic and our international communities.  </p>
        <p>Why do we feel this way?  We feel that when people have the ability to do well, they are able to achieve their daily needs for survival and ensuring they are able to thrive, and they are able to meet their own needs and perhaps the needs of their families and communities. </p>
        <p>We are determined to do good for ourselves and for others and do good by others.</p>
        <p>If we all play the role and keeping our checks and balances on our human rights, then we have achieved what we need to do and our duties as humans to help those deprived or being deprived of their basic human right.  We need to play a role collectively.</p>
        <p>We need to make sure our workplaces, our communities are committed to be humanistic, clean, without child labor, without child trafficking, without basic requirements in our world.</p>
        <p>Petssified.com, Inc. is committed to respecting human rights. Human rights are one of the main areas along with supplier code conduct, anti racism, animal rights that we focus on at Petssified.com. </p>
        <p>We can not solve the world’s problems, but we can highlight where we see it is an issue.  We can listen to our partners, our manufacturers, our distributors and our customers.  </p>
        <p>We can find out from the geographic areas impact analysis of highest human rights issues and violations.  We can refer to  humanrights activists and understand where we can improve.</p>  
        <p>Human rights issues persist in the global economy and affect people in a number of extended supply chains that we ultimately rely on as a business. They are often based on very low income or poverty levels where they are vulnerable human beings and fall into the traps of the mighty who will take advantage of them. For example, the International Labor Organization (ILO) estimates that more than 85 million children are working under hazardous conditions, most in the agriculture sector, and that more than 21 million people are victims of forced labor around the world.2Petssified.com, Inc. does not control and has very limited influence over operations in our extended supply chains. Nevertheless, we believe these practices are unacceptable and that we must renew our individual and collective efforts to take action, boldly test new approaches and form new collaborations to drive sustained progress.</p>
        <p>Approach Our global Human Rights Policy describes our commitment to respecting rights across our valued supply chain line.</p>
        <p>We use the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) at Petssified.com, Inc. for ourselves and for our search in supplies, manufacturers, third party vendors, and distributors.</p>
        <p>The Policy is also informed by the ILO’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. </p>
        <p>Our Supplier Code of Conduct is grounded in international human rights guidance and best practice and identifies the human rights standards we expect our first-tier suppliers to uphold.</p>
        <p>Our approach to human rights reaches our workplaces, suppliers, manufacturers and their workplaces and their extended supply chain. </p>

        <h4>Our Approach in Action</h4>
