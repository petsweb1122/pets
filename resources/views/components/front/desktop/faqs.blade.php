        <p>As of June 21, 2018, the United States Supreme Court changed the laws regarding the collection of sales tax by Online Internet Retailers. We fall within this category.

        <p>We charge sales tax for items shipped to all of the States in the United States.&nbsp; We all need to pay Sales and Use Tax for our orders.</p>
        <p>Petssified.com powered by ViberTEX, Inc. and its eligible affiliates will collect the Simplified Sellers Use Tax (SSUT) and the tax will be remitted on the customer’s behalf to the appropriate Department of Revenue.</p>

        <p>We work with non-kill animal shelters and also those that are kill shelters as there are pets in all of them.&nbsp; We believe that every pet deserves to be adopted.</p>
        <p>We want to ensure that our responsibilities are to ensure these pets get adopted out to great families by promoting the websites, platforms, events from animal rescues, associations, humane societies, animal adoption agencies.&nbsp; With your support, it will only be possible.</p>
