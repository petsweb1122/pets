                 <h3>Pet Care</h3>
                 <p>Owning a furry companion or rather allowing a furry creature to own you is a mutually beneficial and
                    dynamic relationship, with many positive effects. Having a pet is good for your mind, body and soul.
                 </p>

                 <p>Today it is estimated that on international level, over half of the people have a pet living with
                    them. Countries like Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Russia and USA have the highest percentage of pet
                    owners. Owning a pet is a privilege and it should result in a mutually beneficial relationship. Pets
                    have a way of putting a smile on your face. Besides their unconditional and life enriching, love and
                    loyalty, they have been shown to be psychologically, emotionally and physically beneficial. Caring for
                    an animal provides a sense of purpose and fulfillment. However the benefits come with
                    responsibilities.</p>

                 <p class="lead">WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU GET YOUR PUPPY?</p>
                 <p>Getting a dog is a major decision and a long-term commitment
                    in both time and money. However, as challenging as it can get, the rewards are
                    definitely worth the journey. </p>



                 <p>Before your new puppy arrives, make
                    sure you understand its needs. Additionally, make sure you have all the
                    essential supplies your new arrival needs. You need to have:</p>



                 <ul>
                    <li>Puppy
                       food</li>
                    <li>Food
                       and water bowl – ceramic and metal bowl with nonslip rubber bases are excellent
                       choices for young and clumsy puppies. </li>
                    <li>Dog
                       bed – molded plastic beds are relatively chew-proof and easy to clean. Cover
                       them with washable beddings with zip-off covers that can be easily removed for
                       cleaning.</li>
                    <li>Leash
                       and collar – inexpensive, lightweight leashes and collars are ideal for
                       puppies. Once it gets used to them, you can invest in some more expensive and
                       attractive designs. </li>
                    <li>Toys
                       – select several toys for your puppy’s entertainment. It can use them to chew
                       on, squeak or pull. </li>
                 </ul>



                 <p>A young puppy needs four meals a day.
                    It is advisable to feed your new puppy the same food formula the breeder used,
                    for at least 7-10 days after moving in your place. Also try to stick to its old
                    feeding schedule. It is important to make gradual food switches. Sudden changes
                    in the dieting regimen may lead to upsetting its sensitive stomach. Once the
                    puppy is settled and adapted to the new environment and it starts passing
                    well-formed stools, you can begin introducing new foods, by replacing small
                    portions of the old food with new foods.&nbsp;
                 </p>



                 <p>Your puppy also needs to be taken to
                    its toilet area each time it wakes, after each meal and after each session of
                    activity and play. Until it is housetrained, there will be lots of messes to
                    clean up. Never punish your puppy making mistakes. It is still young and it may
                    take him some while until he realizes where his toilet is. If your puppy poops
                    on the wrong place, collect the poop and place it on the right toilet spot.
                    Make sure to clean the area where it pooped with scented but pet-friendly
                    disinfectant. The next time your puppy needs to poop the smell of the
                    disinfectant will repel him, while the smell of his own poop will attract
                    him.&nbsp; </p>



                 <p>No matter how careful you are, your
                    puppy will still find objects to chew and destroy. Put all your worthy
                    belongings out of its reach. Never leave your new puppy unsupervised in new and
                    unknown environments as you cannot know what it may come to its mind. </p>



                 <p>&nbsp;Even young puppies need routine grooming. Depending
                    on the breed, use an appropriate brush to mechanically clean you puppy’s fur.
                    Bathing young puppies is not advisable. Their immune system is underdeveloped
                    and therefore they are very prone to getting cold. Instead of regular baths,
                    you can use dog wipes and baby wipes or dry shampoos and powders. </p>



                 <p>Socialization is the key to raising a
                    well-mannered and well-rounded dog. The more new and interesting experiences a
                    pup has at an early age, the less fearful and more social it will be. Make sure
                    your puppy meets new children, adults and other pets like dogs, cats and small
                    rodents. You also need to expose him to unknown environments and situations. </p>



                 <p>Do not forget that your puppy needs
                    some time out. Let it have frequent, deep and uninterrupted naps. Sleeping time
                    is when the growth hormone is most active and pups need it to grow quickly. </p>



                 <p>Last, but not least, have your puppy
                    regularly checked by a vet. Puppies are very susceptible to infectious disease
                    and both internal and external parasites. Scheduled vaccinations and regular
                    anti-parasite treatments are needed to protect your puppy.&nbsp; </p>



                 <p>Caring for your puppy is not just a
                    matter of disease prevention or calling in the vet when issues develop. Good
                    and responsible care means understanding your puppy’s physiological needs and
                    at the same time integrating your canine companion into what is, from its
                    evolutionary perspective, an alien environment. </p>

                 <p>Bringing a cuddly new kitten into
                    your home is a major decision and a long-term commitment in both time and
                    money. However, as challenging as it can get, the rewards are definitely worth
                    the journey. </p>

                    sure you understand its needs. Additionally, make sure you have all the
                    essential supplies your new arrival depends on. You need to have:</p>

                       bed – molded plastic beds are relatively chew-proof and easy to clean. Cover
                       them with washable beddings with zip-off covers that can be easily removed for
                       cleaning.</li>
                    <li>Litter
                       box – in fact, you will probably need 2 litter boxes. Kittens are very picky
                       and have high standards, so offering them two different litter boxes, increases
                       the chances of the boxes being used. A kitten considers the litter box as its
                       own personal space and it must meet its standards.</li>
                    <li>Toys
                       – select several toys for your kitten’s entertainment. &nbsp;</li>
                 </ul>



                 <p>A young kitten relies entirely on you
                    to ease its transition from the mom cat’s side or shelter to the strange, new
                    home. You need to make a good strategy on how to keep it happy and entertained.
                    Additionally, young kittens learn acceptable behavior from their mothers. If
                    separated too early, it is up to you to fill that void. It is also important to
                    never leave your new kitten unsupervised in new and unknown environments as you
                    cannot know what it may come to its mind. </p>



                 <p>Kitten
                    food is specifically designed to support the intense growth needs of young
                    kittens. Kitten food contains high percentages of high-quality proteins. Since
                    growing kittens are like eating machines, they usually need several meals a
                    day. Another option is to always leave their food bowl full and let them eat
                    when they want and as much as they want. It is advisable to feed your new kitten the same food formula
                    the breeder used, for at least 7-10 days after moving in your place. Also try
                    to stick to its old feeding schedule. It is important to make gradual food
                    switches. Sudden changes in the dieting regimen may lead to upsetting its sensitive
                    stomach. Once the kitten is settled and adapted to the new environment and it
                    starts passing well-formed stools, you can begin introducing new foods, by
                    replacing small portions of the old food with new foods.&nbsp; </p>



                 <p>Assuming that the kitten was
                    separated from its mother and littermates, it is important to make the kitty
                    warm and secure. Providing it with a comfortable bed is the best way to do
                    that. The type of the bed does not matter. You can either make one by covering
                    a box with blankets and pillows or purchase a cat bed from the local pet store.
                    Always place the kitten bed in a calm, quiet place. </p>



                 <p>Fortunately, most kittens prefer
                    being clean and instinctively know how to use the litter box. They might refuse
                    to use it if it is unclean or if the litter is scented, which some kittens find
                    repulsive. However, keep in mind that your new kitten is still young and it may
                    make a mistake or two before getting used to the litter box. It is important
                    not to implement punishments when a mistake occurs. </p>



                 <p>Socialization is the key to raising a
                    well-mannered cat. The more new and interesting experiences a kitten has at an
                    early age, the less fearful and more social it will be. Make sure your kitten meets
                    new children, adults and other cats, dogs and small rodents. </p>



                 <p>Do not forget that your puppy needs
                    some time out. Let it have frequent, deep and uninterrupted naps. Sleeping time
                    is when the growth hormone is most active and kittens need it to grow quickly. </p>



                 <p>Last, but not least, have your kitten

                    Parrots, Pionus Parrots, Quaker Parrots, Parrotlets, Doves, Finches… the list of amazing pet birds is
                    endless. The most amazing thing about birds is that each type has its own personality, traits and
                    characteristics. And with so many types and varieties, there is a perfect bird pet for everyone.
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



                 <p>Before choosing a feathered friend you need to ask yourself:</p>



                 <ul>
                    <li>Is
                       this an impulse purchase or long-term wish. Birds have long life spans and
                       require certain levels of care and maintenance. </li>
                    <li>Can
                       you afford the costs of vet care, bird food, toys and equipment</li>
                    <li>Do
                       you have enough time to interact with the bird. Birds are social creatures and
                       enjoy spending time and playing games with the owner. </li>
                 </ul>



                 <p>If you are sure that you want a
                    feathered bestie and are prepared to be bird parent, the next step is to choose
                    the type of bird. It is important to understand that different bird types have
                    different needs and require different maintenance approaches. If you have
                    troubles deciding which bird suits your lifestyle best, it is recommended to
                    consult with a veterinarian who specializes in birds. </p>



                 <p>To make things simpler we have compiled a list of the
                    friendliest and low-maintenance pet birds: </p>



                 <p><strong>1. Budgies </strong>– are the most popular pet bird in
                    the world. if properly tamed and cared for, they make excellent friends. They
                    are small, easy to maintain and take well to training and can learn to make
                    many tricks. On top of everything else, they can learn how to talk. </p>



                 <p><strong>2. Cockatiels</strong> – are beautiful birds with
                    captivating appearance and friendly, affectionate personalities. If hand-fed
                    when babies and raised in proper environmental conditions, Cockatiels make
                    amazing pets. They cannot talk, but are extremely intelligent and can learn to
                    mimic frequently heard noises such as doorbell sounds and telephone ringtones. </p>



                 <p><strong>3. Cockatoos</strong> – in spite of their size, they are
                    friendly, loving and affectionate. They make deep and profound bonds with the
                    owners, to whom are extremely devoted. They are immensely social and if you do
                    not interact with them enough, can become depressive. If depressed, they turn
                    to destructive behaviors and obsessive feather plucking. </p>



                 <p><strong>4. Parrotlets</strong> – recently their popularity as pets
                    is on the rise. Parrotlets are known for having personalities much larger than
                    their bodies. Taming them requires patience, time and socialization. If
                    properly handled they are extremely loving and affectionate. </p>



                 <p><strong>5. Hyacinth Macaws</strong> – also known as the ,,gentle giants’’ of the avian world. They are
                    playful, gentle and affectionate with sociable and friendly personalities. They enjoy spend their time
                    cuddling with the owners. Due to their size they require certain conditions, but on the long run
                    having a Macaw is a rewarding experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



                 <p><strong>6. Doves</strong> – they are excellent especially if you cannot spend too much time with them.
                    Although they enjoy interacting with the owners, they are capable of entertaining them on their own
                    and do not require too much attention. They are also very clean and easy to care for. </p>



                 <p><strong>7. Finches </strong>– are good choices if you do not have too much free time. They prefer
                    socializing with other birds and if provided with several flock mates and proper flight cage, they do
                    not require handling and out of the playtime. </p>



                 <p><strong>8. Canaries</strong> – they require zero handling and prefer to stay inside their cages. They
                    are capable of making delightful sounds and are very pleasant pet birds. </p>

                 <p class="lead">WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU GET YOUR PUPPY?</p>
                 <p>Tropical fish are fascinating, colorful and amazing. Additionally they make great pets for every
                    household. But they are also part of a highly complex ecosystem that needs consistent, careful,
                    attentive and delicate maintenance. </p>



                 <p><strong>SETTING THE TANK </strong></p>



                 <p>When setting up the tank you need to consider several
                    important factors:</p>



                 <p><strong>1. Location, location,
                       location</strong> – Choose a
                    location that will be least stressful for the fish. Avoid places that are near
                    sound sources (TV, radio), heat sources (radiators, cooling units) and light
                    sources (windows, lamps). A peaceful, moderately illuminated and quiet corner
                    is the best location for setting up the aquarium. </p>



                 <p><strong>2. Filtration system</strong> – After the location is chosen, you
                    need to install a high-quality filtration system. There are three types of
                    filtration&nbsp; systems – mechanical,
                    biological and chemical. </p>



                 <p><strong>3. Heater-stat</strong> – it is a combination of thermostat
                    and heater. The heater-stat should be of appropriate wattage. The wattage
                    should be high enough for the heater to be able to warm up the tank, but not to
                    high, to avoid overheating. </p>



                 <p><strong>4. Air pump </strong>– the air pump produces bubbles which
                    facilitates the fish’s breathing by enabling ease exchange of oxygen and carbon
                    dioxide. In most cases the air pump is optional and serves a decorative
                    purpose. The air pump is crucial for tanks that use too much oxygen (have rich
                    vegetation).</p>



                 <p><strong>5. Tank light</strong> – there are several types of tank
                    lights, but fluorescent lights are the most commonly used. They are
                    inexpensive, simple to install and do not produce too much heat. </p>



                 <p><strong>6. Decorations</strong> – design your tank’s environment.
                    Choose different plants, rocks and ornaments. Keep in mind that the environment
                    should emulate the fish’s natural habitat. </p>



                 <p><strong>7. Test the aquarium</strong> – once everything is set, add water
                    to the tank and see how the aquarium works without fish. Let the systems work
                    for a few days in order to stabilize the environment and make her easily
                    acceptable by the fish. </p>



                 <p><strong>8. Good bacteria</strong> – they help establish the ecosystem
                    your fish need for survival. Good bacteria for tanks can be purchased at pet
                    stores.</p>



                 <p><strong>INTRODUCING FISH TO THE
                       TANK</strong></p>



                 <p>If you are a first time fish owner, start with hardier, more resilient fish that can survive
                    fluctuations in the environmental conditions. Keep in mind that there are hundreds of types of
                    tropical fish and they do not all live well together. Some of them are more aggressive, some are
                    territorial and some are predatory. Make sure to choose the right combination. Another important
                    factor is the number of fish you plan to introduce to your new aquarium. It is important not to
                    overcrowd the tank. Never add more than 3 fish per week. </p>



                 <p><strong>TAKING CARE OF THE FISH
                       AND TANK </strong></p>



                 <p>Feeding is usually easy. All you need is a high quality tropical fish food and some worms to keep your
                    fish fed and happy. Avoid overfeeding the fish. Give them smaller amounts and if needed add some more
                    food. </p>



                 <p>Clean the tank and replace the filters regularly. The environmental conditions have direct influence
                    on your fish’s health. Irregular cleaning and improper maintenance makes the fish stressed and more
                    susceptible to diseases. </p>
