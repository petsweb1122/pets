    <p><strong>OUR STORY</strong></p>
        <p><img style="width: 100%" src="{{url('front/img/about-us.jpg')}}" alt="About Us"></p>
        <hr>
        <p>Our story is simple, you have to be a Pet Lover in order to do what we are doing! We are all pet
            lovers of different Pet Species from dogs, cats, birds, fish, small animals, and farm animals. Many
            of us own more than 1 pet in our homes. Our owners realized a few years ago while they were caring
            for 13 dogs, 3 cats, 3 fish, and 10 birds that there was no single location platform for Pet Owners
            and Pet Lovers to really find the ability to adopt or purchase Pets, Products and Services online.
            Our owners also realized that there was little information about the Pet Brands they were buying
            regarding recalled items for sale, ingredients of the food being purchased or the snacks, nor
            information on what is good for the animals unless you were doing an internet search or you happened
            to hear it via social media.</p>

        <p>In fact in order to work at PETSSIFIED.COM you must own a pet. If you do not own a pet, you must
            participate in sponsoring a pet at one of our Animal Rescues. We are going to make this into a
            Corporate Responsibility for our organization and encourage other organizations to follow our suit!
        </p>

        <p>Petssified.com was created as a convenience for Pet Lovers and Pet Owners to be informed, get
            educated, and still have the luxury of doing the regular shopping for their pets. We are a growing
            company and we are working towards our promise of “Let no Pet be Left Behind”!</p>

        </p>

        <p><strong>A COMPANY WITH A HEART AND A MIND SHARING CULTURE</strong></p>

        <p>The joy that our Pets bring to us in our lives unconditionally, the dependency on us humans from our
            Pets who bring us joy, laughter, unconditional love is what makes us happy, change our own ways,
            provides us company and brings the justice of responsibility to the ultimate measures we know of.
            For this reason alone, PETSSIFIED.COM has created a program of called “Let no Pet be Left Behind”.
            This program is created to help facilitate families and Pet Owners with the appropriate level of
            financial help, education, pet placement, pet services we can provide based on our values and ethics
            of just being good simple people and sharing the wealth and knowledge with our suffering Pets, Pet
            Owners and or their families.</p>

        <p>We are just devastated with the Pets that are abandoned every year for whatever life reason that
            comes up. We do not discriminate against others for their issues or problems, we know that life is
            difficult and responsibilities are not that easy. We also understand the depression that comes with
            the loss of a pet or putting your pet up for adoption. These are the hard facts of life. That is why
            our owners have stated that for each transaction that is spent on the PETSSIFIED.COM platform, a
            portion of it will go directly to the non kill shelters across the country as listed in the site. In
            addition, our owners have asked us to ensure you understand that for life’s problems, you can submit
            your concerns to us directly and we will respond to you. We are here to listen, understand and
            hopefully help improve the lives of our Pets, our Pet Owners and our Pet Lovers. It’s time we work
            together collectively with our partners and our vendors and our customers to make a stand against
            the cruelty towards animals right in our neighborhoods and in our homes. We are not giving up on our
            Pets. We know you aren’t either.</p>
