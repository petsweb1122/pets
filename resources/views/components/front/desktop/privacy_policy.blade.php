		Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) (a coalition of marketing, online advertising, and consumer advocacy
		organizations). See “Advertising Preferences and Opt-out” below to opt-out of such advertising.</p>

	<p>Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on our
		sites directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use
		cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. We do not have access to or
		control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third- party sites may use, and the information
		practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by our Privacy Policy. Please contact
		them directly for more information about their privacy practices.</p>
	<p><strong>ADVERTISING PREFERENCES AND OPT-OUT</strong>
		<br><strong>Cookies</strong>: The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
		accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable
		cookies altogether. If you set your browser to limit or remove cookies or otherwise block our use of cookies,
		some Site features may be unavailable or unable to function properly. Your device may not give you the ability

		may contact our customer service representatives at the phone number or email address below, under Questions.

		that is generated for distribution or is otherwise queued for transmission to you prior to the time when we can
		implement your request. Following receipt of a request from you, we will take reasonable steps to delete your
		information. If you opt-out of marketing communications, you will continue to receive transactional
		communications, such as e-mail or text notifications about your order status, recall information and other
		administrative information. Your information will remain in our database, but will be marked as inactive so you
		do not receive marketing materials from us.</p>

		<br>Opting out will not mean that you will no longer receive our ads, rather, it just means that those ads will
		not be targeted to you based upon data collected from you on our online Services.</p>
	<p><strong>Apps opt-out:</strong> You may use the DAA’s AppChoices program to opt-out of certain interest-based
		advertising in apps (see: https://youradchoices.com/appchoices). You may also select a system level advertising
		preference feature on your device to opt out your device from interest-based advertising in apps.</p>

		by adjusting your mobile device’s location services settings. For instructions on changing the relevant
		settings, please contact your service provider or device manufacturer.</p>
	<p><strong>Do-Not-Track:</strong> Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you
		do not want to have your online activities tracked. Our online Services do not support “do not track”
		preferences that may be available in your browser and are not capable of satisfying the preference you set.</p>
	<p><strong>DATA SECURITY</strong>
		<br>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect the
		information we collect.
		<br>Our Data is stored and hosted in a 3rd Party Hosting Company. This requires constant review and security of
		the data, the securities with our firewalls and our 3rd party Hosting Company.
		<br>However, no information system can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your
		information.</p>
	<p><strong>DATA HOSTING</strong>
		<br>Our Admin Team works with a 3rd party service for hosting of our platform.</p>
	<p><strong>DATA RETENTION</strong>
