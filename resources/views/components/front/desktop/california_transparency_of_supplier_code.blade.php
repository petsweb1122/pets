    <h1>CALIFORNIA TRANSPARENCY OF SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT</h1>	
    <hr>
        <p>At PETSSIFIED.COM, INC. we believe everyone should be treated with fairness, dignity and respect. We are a privately-held, family-owned company seeking to promote and advance respect for human rights across our value chain - from farms, to our suppliers’ factories, to our own workplaces right to the end customer. Although the California Transparency in Supply Chain Acts requires compliance for retailers and company’s reporting revenues above $100 million to comply, PETSSIFIED.COM, INC.  believes in the Act and its requirements.  We are not required to comply, but we are using the principles of the ACT to enforce our suppliers who are above the threshold of$100 million to comply.</p>
        <p>For over the past 7 years, PETSSIFIED.COM, INC.  has engaged in various Supplier and Manufacturers across the globe and domestically.  We have been transparent in our dealings with our suppliers, 3rd party vendors, manufacturers and distributors.  We will continue to ask for the Supplier California Transparency in Supply Chains Act to our Suppliers, Distributors and Manufacturers.</p>
        <p>There is nothing better than keeping the Quality, Responsibility, Mutuality, Efficiency and Transparency in Agreements to ensure the correct services and products are provided to our end customers.</p>
        <p>We work with our supplies, 3rd party vendors, distributors and manufacturers on a principles-based approach to business, and we expect our suppliers to respect human rights in their workplaces.</p>
        <p>Our global human rights approach includes efforts across our own workplaces, oursuppliers and extended supply chains. We are introducing the Supplier Code of Conduct, Supplier Human Rights by validating their workforce,.</p>
        <p>Our Supplier Code of Conduct is informed by the International Bill of Human Rights, the principles set forth in the International Labor Organization’s 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It describes the human rights standards we expect our first-tier suppliers to uphold, covering forced labor, including modern forms of slavery. The Code prohibits the use of all forms of forced labor, including any form of prison, trafficked, indentured or bonded labor. The following areas are included in the Code:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Child Labor</li>
            <li>Compensation &amp; Benefits</li>
            <li>Discrimination</li>
            <li>Environment </li>
            <li>Ethics </li>
            <li>Forced Labor</li>
            <li>Freedom of Association</li>
            <li>Health &amp; Safety</li>
            <li>Issue Reporting</li>
            <li>Work Hours</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>1.</strong> VERIFICATION OF SUPPLY CHAINS</h4>
        <p>We use publicly available data from third party sources such as the U.S. Department of Labor, United Nations Development Program, public media and civil society reports, and proprietary analysis provided by Verisk Maplecroft’s team of human rights risk analytics experts, to assess the social and environmental risks associated with our supply chains. Forced labor and related risks are included in this analysis. This risk assessment and verification helps us determine the actions expected of specific suppliers, which could include a range of efforts, such as completion of a site-specific, third-party validated assessment or a longer-term collaboration as suppliers activate plans to address targeted issues in their workplaces when we work with international suppliers.</p>
        <p>Suppliers are expected to respect rights in their workplaces, and they have an important role in promoting responsible sourcing policies and principles in their own supply chains. As part of our commitment to building supplier capability, we periodically engage suppliers in training and awareness raising to drive continuous improvements.</p>
        <h4><strong>2.</strong> AUDITS OF SUPPLIERS</h4>
        <p>We evaluate human rights risks associated with operating in specific geographies or purchasing specific commodities and services. We engage with relevant suppliers to assess how they manage these risks and their implementation of the expectations set forth in our Code.</p>
        <p>In 2019, we started our Supplier Code of Conduct and we request Supplier Validation and Certification that they are abiding by the rules and regulations as stipulated in our Supplier Policies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We continue to align all of our suppliers with our social, environmental and ethical expectations through our Supplier Code of Conduct. </li>
            <li>Our Code is a key part of our engagement with our suppliers, distributors, manufacturers and 3rd party vendors.</li>
            <li>Our prioritized list of suppliers are selected based on risk and relevance - will complete the personal validation and certification that they are benchmarked on for process, receiving a performance score and the opportunity to receive customized advice, guidance and support from a third party as they take steps to improve or maintain their scores. </li>
            <li>With these insights, our suppliers can strengthen their management systems to address social, environmental and ethical performance.The Supplier Program helps us achieve our goal of working with suppliers that share our values and commitments, and ceasing work with those who are unable or unwilling to meet our expectations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4><strong>3.</strong> CERTIFICATION BY SUPPLIERS</h4>
        <p>We expect our suppliers to align with our Code of Conduct, including its provisions on forced labor.
